## The hardest challenge
* The duels between hunters and hunted are as dramatic as any event in the natural world.
* The stakes could not be higher.
* For both, it's a matter of life and death.
* Yet, surprisingly, it's the hunters that usally fail.
* To have any chance of survival, predators must be perfectly tuned to their own hunting arenas.
* Every habitat brings a different challenge.
* This series will reveal, as never before, the extraordinary range of strategies predators use to catch their prey.
* But even for the most skillful, success is never guaranteed.
* A female leopard on the prowl.
* Few predators instil more fear.
* Yet, out in the open, she has little chance of catching anything.
* To succeed, she must get within a few metres of her prey undetected.
* Her strategy is to use cover, wearing it like a cloak of invisibility.
* She's an expert in stealth.
* Impala are her favourite prey.
* This one is just out of her range.
* She needs to get closer, within four meters.
* She only has a short burst of speed.
* She must stay hidden until she's in the strike zone.
* But out of sight doesn't mean out of mind.
* Impala have acute hearing and a superb sense of smell.
* Now the only prey she can see is right out in the open.
* But leopards are the most versatile of all the big cats, adept at finding cover in the most unpromising places.
* The steep walls of the gully are now her cover for an ambush.
* The male puku is close enough, but he's too big to tackle.
* She needs to slip past him without being seen.
* If he spots her, he'll blow her cover.
* Slowly does it.
* To succeed here, she needs to find prey grazing close to the edge.
* Or better still, in the gully itself.
* Frustration.
* Success would have staved off hunger for a week.
* But while there's prey around, there's hope.
* Peeking over the top is a risk, but it's the quickest way to find a new target.
* A burst of speed of 40mph and it's all over in less than six seconds.
* Except, it isn't.
* Dazed and disorientated, the impala makes a miraculous escape.
* It's been the perfect stealth hunt and she's nothing to show for it.
* But then, six out of seven leopard hunts end in failure.
* A leopard's hunting strategy depends on finding cover.
* But how do you catch your prey in a place where there's literally nowhere to hide?
* That's the challenge facing Zambia's wild dogs.
* This close-knit pack is made up of one adult female and her 12 offspring from last year.
* Unlike the solitary leopard, wild dogs depend for their survival on teamwork.
* Dogs that play together, work together.
* Each morning, the pack heads out across the open plain, prospecting for prey.
* Mother decides which direction they go.
* The rest stay close.
* They'll keep going for miles until they find the right kind of prey.
* Adult zebra are too big a challenge.
* And the same goes for tsessebe.
* An oribi is an easier target.
* But is it worth the effort, especially on an oribi that's as fit and bouncy as this one?
* Better to save their energy for something bigger.
* A wildebeest.
* It's what they've been looking for.
* The dogs need to make the wildebeest run.
* Their success will depend on wearing him down in a long chase.
* While the prey's running, the dogs have the advantage.
* But when the whildebeest stand their ground, the tables are turned.
* Faced with a wall of horns, the pack is powerless.
* But not all the wildebeest have had the courage to stop.
* Now the real contest begins.
* The wildebeest are big and strong.
* But the dogs have stamina.
* Right now, hunters and hunted are clocking 40mph.
* The pack can keep this pace up for miles.
* The wildebeest can't.
* One wildebeest peels off.
* Then another two.
* The split confuses the inexperienced pack, sending them in different directions.
* The mother and one youngster continue on.
* The rest of the pack stop, believing they have an easier target.
* It's a mistake.
* Like a beast with two heads, each bull protects the other's rear.
* And the dogs can do nothing.
* Ahead, the chase continues.
* Another wildebeest peels off.
* Now the mother has just one in her sights.
* But it will mean nothing without the help of the rest of the pack.
* The situation here has reached stalemate.
* The young dogs have lost valuable time.
* They must try and catch up with their mother.
* Back at the front, the mother is beginning to tire.
* And the wildebeest knows it, bouncing to show he's still strong and not worth chasing.
* But fresh, young legs are catching up fast.
* When one dog tires, there's always another member of the team to take up the lead.
* The dogs now have the numbers to bring the wildebeest down.
* Each bite risks a broken jaw, but going for the legs is the only way to stop it.
* And they must do so before it reaches the safety of the herd, a few hundred metres ahead.
* After a 20-minute chase, the bull's energy is near spent.
* This time there will be no sanctuary within the herd.
* The dogs' stamina has been rewarded.
* All they must do now is to bring their quarry to the ground.
* Working as a pack allows wild dogs to take on prey ten times heavier than any one of them.
* But many mouths need a lot of food.
* The price they pay for these numbers is knowing they'll have to attempt the same thing again tomorrow and every day.
* Teamwork and stamina on Africa's open plains have proved to be winning combination.
* But in the dense and complex world of the jungle, hunting is a never-ending game of hide and seek.
* Here, it pays to sit still and blend in because you just never know who's watching.
* The Parson's chameleon is an expert in the see-and-not-be-seen game.
* It lets its eyes do all the work.
* While the rest of its body moves in slow motioin, so as not to scare possible targets.
* The problem is that it can only see prey if it moves.
* So is this a stick insect or stick?
* Ah-hah.
* Time to unleash its secret weapon, a tongue longer than its body.
* The Parson's close cousin, the nasutum chameleon, has the same weapon, but in miniature.
* As small as a matchstick, he needs to get much closer to its prey.
*
