# Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** 是一个静态页面生成工具，可以完美支持Github的博客系统。([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** 您不用了解任何前端配置，就可以便捷创建Jekyll博客。

- 您无须使用任何命令行
- 您不用安装配置ruby，rvm/rbev，ruby gems（如果不使用Jekyll Now，而直接使用Jekyll，前述安装将是您的噩梦）
- 您没有必要安装运行时依赖，如markdown处理器， Pygments等
- 如果您使用Windows系统，这将会使您安装Jekyll更简单
- 非常容易试用，您可以删除fork的源，没有任何影响（就像在系统中卸载绿色软件一样，不会给您带来任何麻烦）

几分钟之内，您就可以设置成功一个最小型的可以响应的博客系统。

## 快速开始

### 步骤1) Fork Jekyll Now的代码到您的仓库

先Fork这个资源，然后修改名称yourgithubusername.github.io。

Your Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if it's not, you can often force it to build by completing step 2)

### 步骤2) 定制并预览您的页面

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the _config.yml file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.

Making a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon

> There are 3 different ways that you can make changes to your blog's files:

> 1. Edit files within your new username.github.io repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below).
> 2. Use a third party GitHub content editor, like [Prose by Development Seed](http://prose.io). It's optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy.
> 3. Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.

### 步骤3) 发布您的第一篇博客

直接编辑 `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md` 就可以发布您的第一篇博客了。

![First Post](/images/first-post.png "First Post")

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

## 本地开发测试

1. 在终端运行`gem install github-pages`，联网安装Jekyll和相关插件。
2. 克隆您fork的资源 `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. 在终端运行 `jekyll serve`，打开本地服务器
4. 在浏览器打开类似http://127.0.0.1:4000/的网址（上一步终端中有提示），随便修改本地配置及文件，马上就可以在浏览器测试效果了
5. 测试完成后，可以提交您的更改到远程的仓库。

## 代码贡献

Issues and Pull Requests are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before I'm more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.

You can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.

I want to keep Jekyll Now as minimal as possible. Every line of code should be one that's useful to 90% of the people using it. Please bear that in mind when submitting feature requests. If it's not something that most people will use, it probably won't get merged. :guardsman:
